# Web-dev-workshop-netflix-clone

Hello everyone 🤗!!

We are more than exited to share that we have successfully completed 😄 the web development workshop.

We started of the session by explaining the basics of web development 🧑‍💻 and it's importance. From beginning the session with the HTML tags to developing Netflix clone, the workshop was a huge success. 🎯

We are happy that we were able to deliver our value through the workshop ☺️.
We believe in providing value and we really appreciate the participants🧑‍💻 for the active participation, because of which we were able to conduct the workshop successfully.


The workshop lasted for about 2 hours⌛ and we ended the 📖workshop with the successful completion of Netflix💻 clone.
All the participants will be receiving the certificates and the participants will also avail the early bird access to our future courses.😍

This workshop would have not been possible without Keerthana H V , Lavanyashree S , and our extended team members coordination. We really appreciate our teams excellent work.🥳
